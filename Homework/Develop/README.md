In this project I have refactored the website to make it more SEO friendly and cleaned up the code.

To make the page more SEO friendly, the following changes were made:
- Given an actual meta-title
- Corrected id tags so that the links function correctly
- Added alt takes to the images to make them meed accessibility standards
- Implemented structural tags to show the page structure more clearly
- Cleaned up the css file and updated css file to replicate new structure style implemented in the html file
- Cleaned up HTML tags for uniformity
