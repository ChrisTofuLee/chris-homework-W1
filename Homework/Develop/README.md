# Webpage optimisation project

## Purpose of the project
The purpuse of this update is to refactor the page to clean up the files while making the coding more SEO friendly.

## What was updated?
To make the page more SEO friendly, the following changes were made:

- Updated meta-title - for usability reasons so that users can identify the page they are on from a web-browser tab
- Corrected id tags - so the links in the nav bar functions correctly
- Added alt tags to the images - this is for user accessibility so that users with visual impairment (or if the image does not load properly) can read what the image is meant to be
- Implemented structural tags - so search engines can better understand the structure of the site
- Cleaned up HTML tags for uniformity and reduce the need for repetition of unnecessary classes
- Cleaned up the CSS file - to avoid repetition within the CSS file and updated targeting to reflect new tags used within the HTML file
- Added title to 'hero' background image - this acts as a alt tag for the image within the CSS file (again for accessibility reasons)
